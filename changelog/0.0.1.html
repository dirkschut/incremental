        <h1>Incremental Changelog v0.0.1 - 2018/11/16</h1>

        <p><a href="changelog.html">Changelog Overview</a></p>

        <p>
            Today is a glorious day, for I have decided to learn JavaScript by creating an incremental game.
            My biggest source of inspiration for this game is Trimps which I have been playing for abotu a week now,
            so you will find many elements of it in this game.
            However, the main feature that this game will have is many resources.
            And I mean MANY. I want a lot of different resources that you will have to manage each and every run.
        </p>
